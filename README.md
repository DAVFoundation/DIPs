# DIPs
DIPs stand for 'DAV Improvement Proposals'. This repository is the main place to suggest improvements to the DAV platform.

# What you can contribute to

We currently accepts DIPs for our [communication protocols](https://developers.dav.network/#communication-protocols), for example, a new use case (new protocol), or additions to an existing one, etc.

In the soon future we will accept DIPs for our DAV SDK, our CLI Tools and more!

# How to contribute

Create your DIP by opening a new issue and filling out the predeifined template

# DIP statuses

The following are the the stages that a DIP may go through:

* **Proposal** - a new DIP that is waiting for review
* **In Review** - a DIP that is open for consideration
* **Accepted** - a DIP that is planned for immediate adoption
* **Integrated** - a DIP that has been accepted and integrated on the DAV platform
* **Hold** - a DIP that is currently not being considered for integration. May be reconsidered in the future
