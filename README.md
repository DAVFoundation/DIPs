# DIPs

This repository is the main place to suggest improvements, changes, and additions to the DAV platform.

## DAV Improvement Proposal Process

The process for proposing an improvement revolves around submitting a DAV Improvement Proposal (DIP) as an issue in this repository, followed by an open discussion around it, drafting of a detailed proposal, acceptance and integration, or moving to hold status.

### DIP statuses

The following are the the stages that a DIP may go through:

* **DRAFT** - a new issue that is open for discussion
* **ACCEPTED** - a DIP that is planned for immediate adoption
* **INTEGRATED** - a DIP that has been accepted and integrated on the DAV platform
* **HOLD** - a DIP that is currently not being considered for integration. May be reconsidered in the future

## DIP Types

DIPs can be proposed for:

* [Communication protocols](https://developers.dav.network/#communication-protocols). For example, a new use case (new protocol), or additions to an existing one.

* Smart Contracts.

* DAV SDK

* DAV CLI tools

## How to contribute

Create your DIP by opening a new issue and filling out the predefined template.
